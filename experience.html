                <p>During VCT Game Changers 2022 Split 3 I got the opportunity to coach the team "SKULLIES". It was a month long project which included me providing VODs, Minor Anti-strats, VETOs and more. This resulted in a TOP 24 position out of 128 teams in the EMEA region. This coach position was temporary as the team was looking for a more experienced coach.</p>
